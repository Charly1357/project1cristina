    <h3>Love Singing</h3>
    <p>The year at its turn,
    the whirring thread unrolls.
    One hour more, the last today,
    and what was living time is scrolls
    of dust dropping into a grave.
    I wait in stern
    
    silence. O deep night!
    Is there an open eye?
    Time, your flowing passage shakes
    these walls. I shiver, my
    one need is to observe. Night wakes
    in solitude. I light
    
    my eyes to all
    that I have done and thought.
    All that was in my head and heart
    now stands like sullen rot
    at Heaven's door. Victory in part -
    the rest a fall
    
    into dark wind
    whipping my house! Yes, this year
    will shatter and ride on the wings
    of storm; not breathe under the clear
    light of stars like quiet things.
    You, child of sin,
    
    has there not been
    a hollow, secret quiver each
    day in your savage chest,
    as the polar winds reach
    across the stones, breaking, possessed
    with slow and in-
    
    sistent rage? Now my lamp
    is about to die; the wick
    greedily sucks the last drop of oil.
    Is my life like smoke lick-
    ing the oil? Will death's cave uncoil
    before me black, damp?
    
    My life breaks down
    somewhere in the circle of
    this year. Long have I known
    decay. Yet my heart in love
    glows under the huge stone
    of passion. I frown,
    
    sweating in deep
    fear, my hands, forehead wet.
    Why? Is there a moist star
    burning through clouds? Is it
    the star of love, with far
    light, dim from fear, a steep
    
    booming note. Do you hear?
    Again! Song for the dead!
    The bell shakes in its mouth.
    O Lord, on my knees I spread
    my arms, and from my drouth
    beg mercy. Dead is the year!
