# Project 1 Cristina

The webpage is aimed at lovers of classical music and give them the possibility
to see the annual events from Cristina Haigis and Peter Hastedt as
well as her company Dico Cantus.

They will be able to see where and when the concerts take place during the
whole year.

As most of the audience come through word of mouth it is also a great possibility
to present the concerts to a new audience

The site user are lovers of classical music but mostly the audience of the
concerts and there friends .It is focussed
on giving them a nice image of what will await them during the concerts.

The idea of this webpage is to enlarge the number of people who visit
the concerts during the year .

### Structure

It follows an easy structure where right on the first webside one can see all
the information one needs .

#### Website Sections:

1. **_Home_** The most complex page where all the information is presented
   with a nice background image and a mp4 reproduction
2. **_Gallery_** Here all the images from various concerts are presented
3. **_Signup_** This gives the users the possibility to suscribe to a newsletter

## Skeleton

The website is really clear and simple it uses on all three pages the same
header and footer so the interaction with the user is always the same and has
no background color that would disturb the UI

## Surface

I have at the **_Homepage_** and the **_Signup_** page the same background image
the **_Gallerypage_** has a mixture of images everything is quite
harmonious
