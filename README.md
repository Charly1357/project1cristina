# Project 1 Cristina

The webpage is aimed at lovers of classical music and give them the possibility 
to see the annual events from Cristina Haigis and Peter Hastedt as 
well as  her company Dico Cantus.


They will be able to see where and when the concerts take place during the 
whole year.

As most of the audience come through word of mouth is it also a great possibility
to present the concerts.

The site  user group are  the audience of the concerts .It is focussed
on giving them a nice image of what will await them during the concerts.

The idea of this webpage is to enlarge the number of people who are able to 
know the place and time  of the concerts  during the year .

### Structure 

It follows an easy structure where right on the first webside one can see all 
the information one needs .

#### Website Sections:

1. ***Home***   The most complex page  where all the information is presented
                with a nice background image and a mp4 reproduction
2. ***Gallery***  Here  all the images from various concerts are presented
3. ***Signup*** This gives the users the possibility to suscribe to a newsletter
   
## Skeleton

   The website is really clear and simple it uses on all three pages the same 
   header and footer so the interaction with the user is always the same and has 
   no background color that would disturb the UI  

## Surface

I have at the ***Homepage*** and the ***Signup*** page the same background image
at the ***gallerypage** I have a mixture of images but everything is quite
harmonious
